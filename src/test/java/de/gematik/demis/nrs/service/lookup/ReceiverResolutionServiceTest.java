    SpecificReceiver requires us to set the id that comes with the Route. This is very easy to do. However, given
    that id is nullable we would either a) need to provide an interface with three parameters where in most cases one
    is null or b) use Route as parameter which is harder to construct for callers (e.g. they'd need to provide actions
    and understand what optional is supposed to do). Yet we still would either have to throw an IllegalArgumentException
     or NPE in case the caller provides SPECIFIC_RECEIVER and no specificReceiverId, which would be permissible due to
     the interface. A third option c) would be to split into two methods but at that point it's easier for the caller
     to do it themselves.
